# FCC-Tribute-Page
A tribute page to Nelson Mandela built using HTML and CSS

Hi, 

This is my first project on the FreeCodeCamp.com. I completed this project after completing the HTML and CSS units on the curiculum. 
On this project I aimed to create a simple and easy to read page using HTML and CSS, I also wanted to be able to use my projects on my new Github page to show potential employers my workings and self study.

To create this I used the FCC forum for help when needed and compared my site to the template given. I also used the web and W3 schools to research when I needed help.

Thanks for looking!
