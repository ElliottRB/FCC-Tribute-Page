# FCC Tribute Page:

This is my first project on the FreeCodeCamp.com. I completed this project after completing the HTML and CSS units on the curiculum. 
On this project I aimed to create a simple and easy to read webpage using HTML and CSS, I also wanted to be able to use my projects on my new Github page to show potential employers my projects and learning.
